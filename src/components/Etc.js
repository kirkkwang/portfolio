          I am currently a student at LEARN Academy where I am learning to
          become a full stack web developer. I have experience with JavaScript,
          React, and Ruby on Rails and general object oriented programming
          concepts. I love working with and using technology to help make
          people’s lives easier. Currently I’ve been serving in the Army
          Reserves for the past 20 years and often I find myself trying to
          access a DOD website and I just want to throw my keyboard against the
          wall and that’s when I think, “Hey, I can make something better than
          this!” Technology should make things better for you and not your blood
          pressure higher. On the civilian side, I’ve been working at an
          academic library at UC San Diego for the last 14 years as a library
          professional, which is a typical desk job where learning Python was
          extremely useful. I want to eliminate predictable and repetitive tasks
          in the workplace and replace them with scripts and automations which
          can free up people’s time to do tasks that actually require human
          intervention. It’s at the UCSD Library where I developed my passion
          for open source technologies, open data, and digital repositories. I
          have great attention to detail, can adapt quickly to new workflows and
          processes, and I think, most importantly, I am great at communication
          such as responding to emails very quickly. I am hoping to become a
          junior developer at a company that cares about service to the public
          and look forward to working in a team based setting.
